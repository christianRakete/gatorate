Installation
------------

The wiringpi project must be installed.
This works (as far as we know) only on 
the raspberry pi - and can't be used 
for testing on desktop machines.

Download at 

    https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/

or 

    git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi

Build via

    cd wiringPi
    ./build

Todo

* Desktop env: don't rely on wiringPi
